LINT'S FATHER
I don't think I am. Who's it from?

LINT'S MOTHER
Well that's just the thing, it doesn't say! It just has
a bunch of handle with care stuff and our address!
It doesn't even have a return address,
isn't that like, not allowed!

LINT'S FATHER
I have no idea, it could be from one of your
relatives gettin' careless and left it off? Doesn't
matter, open it up.
